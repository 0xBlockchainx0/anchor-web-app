# Environments

## Local SSL

The system environment variable `LOCALHOST_HTTPS_CERT` and `LOCALHOST_HTTPS_KEY` are required when you run `yarn run app:start` or `yarn run landing:start` in local.

(WebApp requires https certified by CA to test features such as connectivity and Notification with Walletconnect's wss.)

1. First, you should refer to <https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert> to create a root CA on your Local System.
2. Later, create SSL Cert and Key files using commands such as `mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1`.
3. Enter the SSL Cert and Key file addresses in the `LOCALHOST_HTTPS_CERT` and `LOCALHOST_HTTPS_KEY` system environment variables.
